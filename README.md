# A React context-like solution for Vue.js

[![Latest Version on NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue-expose-inject.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.com/package/vue-expose-inject)

**This package is deprecated! Vue has this functionality built in as of v2.2**

Exposes a set of properties to all of a components descendants.

```js
// Expose a property...
const vm = new Vue({
    mixins: [expose],

    data: () => ({
        bus: new Bus(),
    }),

    expose() {
        return {
            bus: this.bus,
        };
    },
});

// ...to be able to inject it in a child component
const child = new Vue({
    parent: vm,

    computed: {
        ...inject(['bus']),
    },
});

child.bus; // EventBus instance
```

## Install

You can install the package via yarn:

```bash
yarn add vue-expose-inject
```

## Use Cases

This package is based on React's [context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) feature. Exposes and inject are useful for giving your components access to global-ish objects, like event busses or authentication data. Expose/inject can make your application harder to reason about, and depends on a certain hierarchy with your components, so use with care!

## Usage

Child components can inject properties that are exposed by one of their ancestors. This goes beyond parent-child communitation, the distance between the parent and child, grandchild, etc. doesn't matter.

To get started, expose an object from a parent component by adding the `expose` mixin and an `expose` function, which returns the object:

```js
// Parent.js

import { expose } from 'vue-expose-inject';

export default {
    mixins: [expose],

    expose() {
        return {
            bus: new Bus(),
        };
    },
}
```

Vue instance properties can also be exposed by passing their names in an array:

```js
export default {
    mixins: [expose],

    data: () => ({
        bus: new Bus(),
    }),

    expose: ['bus'],
}
```

Descendant components can then inject the property using the `inject` helper function, which uses the same syntax as Vuex's `map` helpers:

```js
// Child.js

import { inject } from 'vue-expose-inject';

export default {
    parent: vm,

    computed: {
        ...inject(['bus']),
    },
}
```

> If you try to inject a property that hasn't been exposed by an ancestor, an error gets thrown

Injected properties can be renamed by passing in an object instead of an array:

```js
export default {
    // ...

    computed: {
        ...inject({
            myBus: 'bus',
        }),
    },
}
```

If you're not using the spread operator, you can `assign` the properties:

```js
export default {
    // ...

    computed: Object.assign(inject(['bus']), {
        // My computed properties...
    }),
}
```
